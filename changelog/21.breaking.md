Updated to the new logic which has been specified for the algorithm.

This changes the outputs in a few key cases:

- dimensions of "sdepth10" now lead to a vertical label of "d100cm" for consistency with how "sdepth1" is handled
- support for more dimension levels (e.g. "depth300m", "depth700m") has been added
- the horizontal label "Ht" is now "ht" (fixed after there was a fix to a typo in the specification document)
