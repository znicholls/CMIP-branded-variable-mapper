Fixed a bug in the temporal label generation.
Previously, if a variable had "time" in its name (but was not actually equal to "time"), the temporal label would nonetheless be "tavg".
This has now been fixed so that "ti" is returned for unrecognised dimensions, even if they contain "time" as a substring.
