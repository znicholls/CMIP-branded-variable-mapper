    - if there is "sdepth100cm" in dimensions, the vertical label is now "d100cm"
    - "sdepth10" in dimensions is no longer supported so the vertical label would now be "u"
    - if there is "olevel" in dimensions, the vertical label is now "ol"
    - if there is "olevhalf" in dimensions, the vertical label is now "olh"
    - if there is "alevel" in dimensions, the vertical label is now "al"
    - if there is "alevhalf" in dimensions, the vertical label is now "alh"
    - if there is "oplayer4" in dimensions, the vertical label is now "op4"
