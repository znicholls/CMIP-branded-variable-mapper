Added support for "tminavg" and "tmaxavg" in line with updates to Table F1 of [Taylor et al.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19jzecgymgiiEsTDzaaqeLP6pTvLT-NzCMaq-wu-QoOc/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0) as at 22 September 2025

If you have a variable with "time4" as a dimension and "time: max" ("time: min") in the cell methods, the temporal label is now "tmaxavg" ("tminavg") rather than "ti" as it was previously.

In addition, if you have "time: max", "time: min" or "time: sum" in your cell methods
but do not have a "time" dimension, your temporal label will now be "ti"
rather than its previously value.
