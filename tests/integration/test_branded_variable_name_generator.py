"""
Tests of our generation of branded variable names
"""

# Tests to write:
# - Given a CMIP6 variable name and cell methods, do we get expected output
# - Match the behaviour specified in the excel table
# - Given a branded variable, get back to CMIP6 variable and cell methods
# - Round tripping
# - If you give an uncreognised name, you get a sensible error
